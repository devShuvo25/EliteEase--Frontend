  content: `<h2>Engineered for Extreme Workflows</h2><p>The CalDigit TS4 stands alone as the most powerful Thunderbolt 4 dock ever created, offering a staggering 18 ports of connectivity that transform any laptop into a high-tier desktop workstation. At its core, the TS4 is designed to eliminate the bottleneck of modern mobile computing. With a dedicated 2.5Gb Ethernet port, users experience nearly triple the networking speed of standard gigabit connections, which is essential for NAS users and professional video editors working with high-bitrate footage. The inclusion of three Thunderbolt 4 ports ensures that daisy-chaining high-speed NVMe storage and dual 6K displays doesn't result in a drop in performance, maintaining a consistent 40Gb/s bandwidth across the entire bus.</p><h2>Superior Power and Thermal Management</h2><p>One of the most overlooked aspects of the TS4 is its sophisticated power delivery system. Providing up to 98W of sustained power to the host laptop, it ensures that even power-hungry 16-inch workstations remain topped up during heavy rendering tasks. Unlike cheaper alternatives that throttle speeds when they get hot, the TS4 features a rugged, vertically-finned aluminum chassis that acts as a massive passive heat sink. This thermal design allows the internal controller to maintain peak data transfer rates without thermal throttling. Additionally, the front-facing UHS-II SD and microSD 4.0 slots are a godsend for photographers, offering the fastest possible offload speeds directly to the system memory without needing external adapters.</p><h2>Versatility for Every Peripheral</h2><p>The TS4 is more than just a port expander; it is a connectivity hub that respects legacy and modern hardware alike. With five USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports and three USB-C ports, it accommodates everything from low-latency mechanical keyboards to high-speed audio interfaces. The intelligent 'Offline Charging' feature allows you to charge your smartphone or tablet through the front USB ports even when your laptop is disconnected or powered down. For audio professionals, the TS4 includes high-fidelity audio jacks on both the front and rear, simplifying cable management for speakers and headsets. It is a masterclass in hardware engineering, designed for those who refuse to compromise on their digital workspace.</p>`,
